Project for university full stack development course. A single page application which lets the user play a simplified game of blackjack.
Features:
- Account creation and user authentication.
- Blackjack game logic stored on the backend, including shuffling, drawing, and scoring.
- The dealer draws two cards, and shows you the first one. Draw cards without going over 21 points, and click "STOP DRAWING" to reveal the dealer's hand. You win if you beat the dealer's score without going over 21.
